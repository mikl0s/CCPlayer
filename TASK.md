## Discovered During Work

- Need to research wgpu best practices for video rendering
- Consider using ringbuffer for audio samples
- Investigate optimal frame buffer size for smooth playback
- Winit 0.30 has different event loop API - using EventLoopWindowTarget instead of direct ControlFlow
- Need to implement proper DPI scaling for high-DPI displays
- Consider adding smooth resize animation for better UX
- May need to add Windows-specific hit testing for better resize performance
- Need to implement overlay rendering for UI elements (volume, controls)
- Consider implementing HDR support in the future (tone mapping prepared in shader)
- May need to optimize texture uploads for 4K/8K video
- Should add support for more exotic pixel formats (P010 for 10-bit)
- Need to handle GPU device lost scenarios gracefully
- FFmpeg-next 7.0 has different API than rusty_ffmpeg - using ffmpeg-next for better maintenance
- Hardware acceleration context creation needs platform-specific handling
- Frame timing and A/V sync will need careful tuning for smooth playback
- Consider implementing frame pre-buffering for seeking performance
- May need to add support for subtitle rendering in the future
- Audio resampling to 48kHz float32 for consistent audio pipeline
- CPAL 0.15 has good low-latency support but may need platform-specific tuning
- Ring buffer size may need adjustment based on system performance
- Device hot-plug detection requires polling on some platforms
- Consider implementing audio fade-in/fade-out for seamless transitions
- May need to add support for audio filters (EQ, reverb) in the future
- ASIO driver detection on Windows requires additional setup
- Audio clock drift compensation may be needed for long playback sessions
- Need to implement proper shutdown handling for clean thread termination
- Consider implementing frame pre-loading for smoother seeking
- May need to add buffering state UI feedback for network streams
- Should implement playlist file format support (M3U, PLS)
- Need to handle window events in separate thread to avoid blocking
- Consider adding support for multiple audio tracks
- Should implement subtitle rendering in the future
- May need to optimize thread communication for lower latency
- Need to add hotkey customization support
- Should implement video filters (brightness, contrast, etc.)
- Consider adding support for video screenshots with timestamps
- Need to implement proper DPI scaling for UI elements
